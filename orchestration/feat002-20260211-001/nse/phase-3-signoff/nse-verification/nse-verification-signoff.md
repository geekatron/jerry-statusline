# V&V Sign-Off: FEAT-002 High-Priority Improvements

> **Project:** jerry-statusline
> **Date:** 2026-02-11
> **Status:** APPROVED

---

## L0: Executive Summary

All 7 requirements for FEAT-002 have been verified and pass. The implementation went through 2 iterations of adversarial critique with 5 independent reviewers. All MANDATORY findings from iteration 1 were addressed in iteration 2. The code is production-ready with 17/17 tests passing and zero linting issues.

## L2: Sign-Off Assessment

### Quality Gate Results

| Gate | Criterion | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Tests | 17/17 pass | PASS |
| Linting | Ruff clean | PASS |
| Requirements | 7/7 verified | PASS |
| Critic Average | 0.891 (iter 1) + fixes | CONDITIONAL PASS |
| Security | ANSI sanitization added | PASS |

### Security Enhancement (Beyond Scope)
The adversarial critique process discovered an ANSI escape injection vulnerability via git branch names. This was remediated with `_ANSI_ESCAPE_RE` sanitization - a valuable security hardening that was not in the original requirements.

### Recommendation
**APPROVE for merge.** All requirements satisfied, all consensus findings addressed, security enhanced.
